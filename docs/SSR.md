## SSR with cooling system

This is an example schematic of how to make your own SSR with a cooling fan.
Since this system is designed to function fully independently \
(no monitoring or intervention from a human) monitoring the TRIAC temperature is highly recommended,\
since they can overheat and cause fire.

The scheme also includes example values for snubber circuits designed and tested to work for ~1kw induction motors.
In case of an issue with random firing of the TRIAC, values need to be changed/increased. \
__Each induction motor needs its own individual values in order to bypass random firing issues.__
